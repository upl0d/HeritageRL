🌟 HeritageRL 🌟
🎮 HeritageRL is a roguelike game project built with Python 🐍 and libtcod. It’s my first step into the world of programming and game development, serving as a personal learning journey to explore the fundamentals of game mechanics and design.

📖 About the Project
HeritageRL is a work in progress 🚧 and is designed to help me learn the basics of:

🗺️ Procedural Map Generation
🎲 Turn-Based Mechanics
🛠️ Core Systems: Entity management, interaction, and basic game loops
⚠️ Note: The game is not yet playable but will be updated as development progresses.

🚀 Current Progress
✅ Implemented Features:

Basic entity movement
Early game loop foundation
🔄 Work in Progress:

Procedural map generation
Combat mechanics
Inventory systems
📅 Roadmap
Here's what's planned for future updates:

 Complete procedural map generation 🗺️
 Add combat mechanics ⚔️
 Introduce inventory and item systems 🎒
 Create a playable demo 🎮
🙌 Acknowledgements
This project is inspired by the roguelike genre and serves as my introduction to Python programming and game development. Special thanks to the libtcod community for their awesome library! 💡
